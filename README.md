# ART Intake Prediction
In the healthcare industry, understanding patient adherence to treatment is important for efective patient management. This illustrates the necessity for predictive models that can show patient behaviors and anticipate responses to therapies. This project proposes the development of a predictive model tailored predict patient adherence to Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART). By delving into patient reactions and identifying influential factors, this model aims to provide insights for the healthcare industries to understand how patients reacts to ART treatment. 

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains null values which was appropriately dealt. Understanding the percentage of the null values is very important and the variables having above 50% null values was removed as these kinds of variables might not be of any importance to our model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Some valuable insight on factors affecting patient adherence to ART treatment was generated.
